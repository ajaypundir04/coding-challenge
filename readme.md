### 1. **Largest Sibling of a Number**
- **Concept**: Given a number, rearrange its digits to form the largest possible number.
- **Approach**:
    1. Convert the number to a string and sort the digits.
    2. Reverse the sorted digits to get the largest number.
- **Time Complexity**: O(d * log(d)), where `d` is the number of digits in the number.

### 2. **N-th Largest Number in an Unsorted Array**
- **Concept**: Find the nth largest number in an unsorted array.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to maintain the n largest elements.
    2. Add elements to the heap. If the heap size exceeds n, remove the smallest element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the number of elements and k is the value of n.

### 3. **Castle on Hills - Count Peaks and Valleys**
- **Concept**: Count the peaks and valleys in a list of land heights.
- **Approach**:
    1. Traverse the array and check for elements that are greater than both neighbors (peak) or smaller than both neighbors (valley).
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### 4. **Parse a Large CSV File and Extract Data**
- **Concept**: Parse CSV formatted data and extract each line into an array.
- **Approach**:
    1. Split each line using commas and store the results in a list.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of lines.

### 5. **Two Sum - Find Indices of Two Numbers That Add to the Target**
- **Concept**: Find two indices in an array such that their values add up to a target number.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a hashmap to store the numbers and their indices.
    2. For each number, check if its complement (target - number) exists in the hashmap.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### 6. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
- **Concept**: Find the length of the longest substring that doesn't contain repeating characters.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a sliding window (two pointers) and a set to keep track of characters.
    2. Expand the window and adjust the left pointer when a character repeats.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### 7. **Maximum Subarray - Kadane’s Algorithm**
- **Concept**: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use dynamic programming: keep track of the current sum and the maximum sum encountered so far.
    2. If the current sum becomes negative, reset it.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements.

### 8. **Product of Array Except Self**
- **Concept**: Calculate the product of all elements in an array except the current one, without using division.
- **Approach**:
    1. Compute the product of elements to the left of each element.
    2. Compute the product of elements to the right of each element.
    3. Multiply the left and right products for each element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements.

### 9. **Move Zeroes to End**
- **Concept**: Move all zero elements in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a pointer to move non-zero elements to the front.
    2. Fill the remaining positions with zeroes.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### 10. **Merge Intervals**
- **Concept**: Merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.
- **Approach**:
    1. Sort the intervals by their starting point.
    2. Traverse through the intervals and merge overlapping ones.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.

### 11. **Container with Most Water**
- **Concept**: Find the maximum area between two lines on the x-axis.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a two-pointer approach, starting from both ends.
    2. Calculate the area and move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of lines.

### 12. **Rotate Array**
- **Concept**: Rotate an array by k steps to the right.
- **Approach**:
    1. Reverse the entire array.
    2. Reverse the first k elements and the remaining elements.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### 13. **Find Duplicate Number**
- **Concept**: Find the duplicate number in an array (with a range of 1 to n).
- **Approach**:
    1. Use Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (cycle detection) algorithm to find the duplicate.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements.

### 14. **Group Anagrams**
- **Concept**: Group words that are anagrams of each other.
- **Approach**:
    1. Sort each word and use it as a key in a hashmap to group the anagrams.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n k log k), where n is the number of words and k is the length of the longest word.

### 15. **Valid Parentheses**
- **Concept**: Check if a string has valid parentheses.
- **Approach**:
    1. Use a stack to match opening and closing parentheses.
    2. For each character, push opening ones to the stack and pop when encountering closing ones.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Key Tips for Interview Preparation:
1. **Understand Time Complexity**: Focus on algorithms with optimal time complexities, such as O(n) or O(n log n). Avoid brute force solutions when more efficient ones exist.

2. **Data Structures**: Many of the problems make use of common data structures like HashMaps, Stacks, Heaps, and Arrays. Be sure to practice problems involving these.

3. **Practice Coding**: Write the solutions and practice solving them under time constraints. This will help reinforce the logic and improve speed.

4. **Understand Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases like empty arrays, null inputs, etc., in your solutions.
